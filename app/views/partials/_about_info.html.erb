Youi is many things. Initially, it is a website where its styles are crowd-sourced. This means that any person in the entire world can contribute to how the website looks (even your grandma). Additionally, Youi offers individual users to build custom CSS templates using our engine. This tool can help the non-technical sort create beautiful websites, non-artistic developers enhance their websites, or anyone who is looking to have some creative fun on the Internet! Youi takes away the frustration of stylizing sties with limiting tools such as WordPress or Squarespace, and really puts you in the driverâ€™s seat.
