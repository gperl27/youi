Youi is a web application that aims to automate styling by generating CSS based on simple user inputs.The app does not require any technical knowledge, yet novices and professionals can will find Youi useful. There are three main features of the app:

## Crowd-sourced Main Page

The main page is crowd sourced in that any person in the world can make changes to it. This page acts as a demonstration of the engineering, as well as deep dive into macro-decision making and a digital art expedition.

## Custom Templating

Users can create and save their own CSS templates using this feature.

## Analytics Platform

This section of the website visualizes user inputs on a per-vote basis. Marketers or UX designers may find this tool useful for making stylistic or material decisions.
